# Introduction

MaltReport is an OpenDocument/OfficeOpenXML powered reporting engine for .NET and Mono, it is inspired by the excellent [Relatorio Project](http://relatorio.openhex.org/).

There is a briefly introduction in Chinese: [MaltReport2 中文使用简介](http://www.cnblogs.com/oldrev/p/maltreport2_intro.html)

MaltReport **DO NOT REQUIRES** MS-Office or LibreOffice to render report, on the contrary, MaltReport manipulates ODT/ODS/XLS/DOC file by itself, so it could be fast & reliable. 

The template of your report is just a normal document created with LibreOffice or MS-Word/MS-Excel (ODT/ODS and XLS/DOC are fully supported), 
we can use LibreOffice and MS-Word/Excel as WYSIWYG report development tools.

I do not have too much time working with the document, so to learn the usage of MaltReport please see the Sandwych.Reporting.Demo project.
